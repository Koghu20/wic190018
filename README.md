   If num1> 50
	Print “Greater than 50”

	Print “ Less than 50”
End
```
3.	Print the pass/fail grade based on the mark entered by user. The passing mark is at least 40.

6.	Print the minimum number from 10 random numbers generated by computer. 
```
Start
    Input num
     C=1
      Min=num
      While (c<10)
	Input num
	If (min>num)
	    Min=num
	Endif
	C++
       Endwhile
Print min
End 
```

7.	Print the number of odd and even number from 10 random numbers generated by computer. The random number must be from 10 – 100. 
```
Start
Odd=0
Even=0
C=0
While (c<10)
	Input num
	    If (num%2=0)
		Even=even+1
	    Else 
		Odd=odd+1
	   Endif 
	    C=c+1
Endwhile 
Print even , odd
End 
```
